Hello! I am **Valerian Pratama**. I graduated with bachelor degree in mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2021 and with master degree in mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung in October 2022. As of April 2023, I am working as a data engineer at Merkle Indonesia (after previously interning here). In tech, my interest lies in cloud technology, data engineering, and data/MLOps.

For my undergraduate thesis, I wrote an exposition on Eilenberg-MacLane space. This is a topological space with only one nontrivial homotopy group. On the thesis, I showed the existence of such spaces and the fact that for sufficiently well-behaved space (well, in this case it's CW complex), it's unique up to weak homotopy equivalence. For my master thesis, I learnt about simplicial sets and some simplicial homotopy theory to bridge construction for quasicategory -- a certain model for $\infty$-category.

Outside of mathematics, I like to play tower defense game (mainly Arknights), hiking/camping (still learning to do it solo!), and listening to music (mainly JPop/Mandopop -- although I can't speak either Japanese or Chinese lol). For music, my main setup is Hifiman Sundara + Fiio Q3 DAC. Some of my favourite utaite is Akie, HACHI, Kano, and Machita Chima. I also like to listen to game soundtrack, usually looping soundtrack from Blue Archive, VA-11 HALL-A, Dark Souls Trilogy, or Arknights while working.

For a bit more look to my music preference, here's my (curated) YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUmSBNs2YOUWp-USa3rfgZUN9rQWy6X54).
